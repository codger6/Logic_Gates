Papilio Pro Project 3 - demonstrate logic gates

  Simple project using the Megawing logic board.
  This uses the switches and LEDs to demonstrate the OR,AND,XOR and NAND logic functions.

  Switch 0 and Switch 1 are OR'd and output to LED 0.
  Switch 2 and Switch 3 are AND'd and output to LED 2.
  Switch 4 and Switch 5 are XOR'd and output to LED 4.
  Switch 6 and Switch 7 are NAND'd and output to LED 6.

  I am new to fpga design but not to digital electronics.
  This is my third project, created to familiarize myself with FPGA usage and VHDL programming.
